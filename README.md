# cryptosecurity
A multipurpose, open-source tool in .NET for encryption and decryption with the RSA Algorithm. Computes public and private keys, that too with inefficient algorithms. between 0 to 10 seconds, and provides useful methods for reading and writing the public and private keys, and ciphertext to files. 

Command Line release will be released soon, and GUI is in the works.

Please note that the program, while cross-platform, does not work with other rsa keys at this moment; You can only use keys generated by this program to decrypt encrypted files/text.
